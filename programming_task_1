'''
This program takes a list of integers and joins digits side-by-side, into one single number.

INPUT: [8, 3, 5, 1]
OUTPUT: 8351

The program does this by...
    Step 1. Loops through each digit in a list.
    Step 2. Each digit is added to 10 times the current value of the variable, 'final_integer'.
            This allows for the digit to be placed into the correct place value.
    Step 3. The 'joined' final integer is then output to the console, along with its class type to confirm it is an integer.

# A list containing various integer digits.
list_ints = [9,3,4,6] # <- Try testing it by changing the inputs!

# Variable to store the final, joined integer value. Initialised as 0.
final_integer = 0

# Loops through each integer in the list.
for integer in list_ints:
    # Multiplies the existing 'final_integer' value by 10 to move the existing number over by one place value. Adds the next integer to the end.
    final_integer = (final_integer * 10) + integer

# Stores the class of the 'final_integer' variable.
final_type = type(final_integer)

# Prints out both the variable and type of 'final_integer' 
print(final_integer)
print(final_type)
