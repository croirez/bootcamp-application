"""
Guessing Number Game.
This program asks a user to guess a randomly generated number (between 1 and 100).

Example Use-case:
INPUT: 5
(random_int = 41)
OUTPUT: You guessed too low!

The program does this by...
    Step 1. Retrieving and validating the user's guessed integer
    Step 2. Generating the random integer
    Step 3. Comparing the two integers, giving feedback on the results
